  Notes are actually _annotated blocks_, which are blocks surrounded by an
  annotation (here, the annotation is `Note`). You can use many other
  annotations (such as  `Example`, `Use case`, etc..), as with annotations
  will be translated to a lower-case class attribute in your resulting
  HTML document. So you simply have to add the styles you want in your CSS
  stylesheet to support more annotations blocks.

      Note ________________________________________________________________

      As with lists, _indentation is primordial_. Your note block should be
      more indented than the parent paragraph. All paragraphs with the same
      indentation level as the note will be considered part of the note.
