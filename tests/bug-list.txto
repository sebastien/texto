There are a few things to know about implementing pages:

- Each page should have its root node referenced as `page` (add a `jsx::ref=page` on the root node)

- When a page has *speech bubbles*, they should be registered as `bubbles` (using `jsx::ref=bubbles`).
  These nodes will be introspected by the pages component to position the narrator based on the step.

- The page can defined a `step` cell that defines its current step (and hence which speech bubble to
  display). When present, this cell will be proxied by the pages component.
